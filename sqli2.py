"""
Again, start with writing out the steps in plain English.

1. Import the sqlite3 library.
2. Connect to the database.
3. Establish a cursor.

4. Using an infinite loop, continue to ask the user to enter the number of an operation that theyâ€™d like to perform.
   If they enter a number associated with a SQL function, then run that function.
   However, if they enter number not associated with a function, ask them to enter another number.
   If they enter the number 5, exit the program.

Clearly, step 4 needs to be broken up into multiple steps. Do that before you start writing any code.

Good luck!
